Anna scans through the isle of wines staring at her and sighs. She needed to shop for some nice bottles of wine that everyone would enjoy during the celebratory dinner she was having with her flatmate who just got promoted at work. She felt quite overwhelmed by the huge array of wines before her. She picks up a bottle up and wonders to herself “what will this taste like? I wish there was a way I could find out before buying it” She picks up another attractive looking bottle, looks through the ingredients and then at the price, she returns it thinking to herself “I don’t want to spend 10€ on a bottle of wine that might not taste good” . Exasperated, she grabs a bottle of red wine and another bottle of white wine, hoping they don’t turn out to be horrible, she heads to the cashier to pay for them.
