Data Access Object
Allow code to access schemas/collections in the database

http://best-practice-software-engineering.ifs.tuwien.ac.at/patterns/dao.html
Use a Data Access Object when:

you need to access a persistent storage more than one time, especially if you want to exchange the data source later.
you want to separate a data resource's client interface from its data access mechanisms
you want to adapt a specific data resource's access API to a generic client interface
in a larger project, different teams work on different parts of the application: the DAO pattern allows clean separation of concerns.
