*Must haves of the app:
*Price! propably with some filters like: low to high etc.
*Flavour description - key differentiator.
*Saved wines I liked before, also maybe some similar recommendations if the exact one is not available in the shop.
*Additional info: food pairings, wine type, ratings - community rating, not in numbers e.g. "Loved it!".
*Nice to have:
*Offline function.
*Hashtag / tag functions for saved wines (e.g. occasions, foods etc).
